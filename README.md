# Spartan Scheduler Prototype

## What is this?
This project was created for SpartaHack, the MSU hackathon. The purpose was to be a website that students would be able to schedule private tutoring sessions.

## Is this done?
This is far from being done. The project was continued but we decided to go to an app approach, so we currently the app is on developing for iOS
